# jsk_fetch_startup

## SetUp (Running following commands in the first time)

### Install a udev rule
```bash
rosrun jsk_fetch_startup install_udev.sh
```

#### For realsense
udev rule have to be manually installed according to [this issue](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/issues/1426) when using realsense-ros from ROS repository.

```bash
wget https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/raw/master/config/99-realsense-libusb.rules
sudo mv 99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Install supervisor config files. e.g. `robot.conf`, `jsk_fetch_startup.conf` ...

```
su -c 'rosrun jsk_fetch_startup install_supervisor.sh'
```

To show or change supervisor job status, access `supervisor.FETCH_FQDN` by web browser.

Previously, upstart was used, but it has been moved to supervisor. This is because of the convenience of job management via a web browser.

### cron
Install cron jobs for root user and fetch user. e.g. `shutdown`, `update_workspace`.

```
su -c 'rosrun jsk_fetch_startup install_cron.sh'
```

### mongodb

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/robot/mongodb_store/

# to see the db items from http://lcoalhost/rockmongo
sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mongo
wget "http://rockmongo.com/downloads/go?id=14" -O rockmongo.zip
unzip rockmongo.zip
sudo mv rockmongo-1.1.7 /var/www/html/rockmongo
# manually change following line in /var/www/html/rockmongo/config.php
# $MONGO["servers"][$i]["control_auth"] = false; // true;//enable control users, works only if mongo_auth=false
```

### Coral Edge TPU
Create ROS workspace for Coral Edge TPU. Please see:
https://github.com/knorth55/coral_usb_ros

### Teleoperation

For the JSK safe teleop system, please see [data flow diagram of safe_teleop.launch](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot/tree/master/jsk_robot_common/jsk_robot_startup#launchsafe_teleoplaunch)

The numbers assigned to the joystick are as follows.

## Maintenance

### re-roslaunch jsk_fetch_startup fetch_bringup.launch
```
sudo supervisorctl restart jsk-fetch-startup
```

### re-roslaunch fetch_bringup fetch.launch
```
sudo supervisorctl restart robot
```

### [Clock Synchronization](https://github.com/fetchrobotics/docs/blob/0c1c63ab47952063bf60280e74b4ff3ae07fd914/source/computer.rst)

install `chrony` and add ```server `gethostip -d fetch15` offline minpoll 8``` to /etc/chrony/chrony.conf, restart chronyd by `sudo /etc/init.d/chrony restart` and wait for few seconds, if you get
```
$ chronyc tracking
Reference ID    : 133.11.216.145 (fetch15.jsk.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp)
Stratum         : 4
Ref time (UTC)  : Wed Oct 26 12:32:56 2016
System time     : 0.000006418 seconds fast of NTP time
Last offset     : 0.003160040 seconds
RMS offset      : 0.003160040 seconds
Frequency       : 11.749 ppm fast
Residual freq   : -137.857 ppm
Skew            : 6.444 ppm
Root delay      : 0.185045 seconds
Root dispersion : 0.018803 seconds
Update interval : 2.1 seconds
Leap status     : Normal
```
it works, if you get `127.127.1.1` for `Reference ID`, something wrong


## Network
### General description
Fetch has wired and wireless network connections.
If we use both of wired and wireless connections as DHCP, DNS holds two IP addresses for same hostname (fetch15 in this case).
This cause problems in network such as ROS communication or ssh connection.

The solution we take now (2016/11/01) is using wired connection as static IP.
By doing so, DNS holds only one IP adress (for wireless connection) for fetch hostname.

### Case description
If you see the following result, it is OK.
```
$ nslookup fetch15.jsk.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp
Server:         127.0.1.1
Address:        127.0.1.1#53

Name:           fetch15.jsk.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp
Address: 133.11.216.145
```

If two or more IP addresses apper, something is wrong.
Please connect display, open a window of network manager, and check that wired connection uses static IP.

### Access point
Define access point setting, such as ssid:
```
cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
```

### Log

tmuxinator makes it easy to check the important logs of fetch from command line. Currently, it shows the logs of the supervisor jobs.

Install tmuxinator config.
```bash
rosrun jsk_fetch_startup install_tmuxinator.sh
```

Show logs
```bash
tmuxinator log
```

### Show all logs


```bash
tmuxinator log
```

  - `pulseaudio` is required to register USB speaker on head in boot.
- 2019/04/19: set `env DISALLOW_MODULE_LOADING=0` in `/etc/init/pulseaudio.conf`.
  - this modification is needed for overriding default speaker setting in `/etc/init/jsk-fetch-startup.conf`

  - We sent PR to upstream [fetchrobotics/fetch_robots PR#40](https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_robots/pull/40).
- 2019/04/19: run `/etc/ros/indigo/robot.launch` with `arg` `launch_teleop:=false`.
  - `teleop` in `/etc/ros/indigo/robot.launch` nodes were conflicted with `teleop` nodes in [jsk_fetch_startup/launch/fetch_teleop.xml](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot/blob/master/jsk_fetch_robot/jsk_fetch_startup/launch/fetch_teleop.xml)
