## How to setup develop environment
For more details about Spot and KINOVA arm,
please see [jsk_spot_robot](https://github.com/sktometometo/jsk_robot/tree/develop/spot/jsk_spot_robot#setup-a-catkin-workspace-for-spot-driver) and
[jsk_kinova_robot](https://github.com/708yamaguchi/jsk_robot/tree/spot-kinova/jsk_kinova_robot#how-to-setup-development-environment)

### Setup a workspace for spot and kinova
You need to install `conan` (Decentralized, open-source (MIT), C/C++ package manager) to build kinova packages  
If you have not installed `conan`, please see [Conan Setup](https://github.com/708yamaguchi/jsk_robot/tree/kinova-gen3/jsk_kinova_robot#conan-setup) and install `conan`
```bash
mkdir ~/spotkinova_ws/src -p
cd spotkinova_ws/src
wstool init .
wstool merge -t . https://raw.githubusercontent.com/708yamaguchi/jsk_robot/spot-kinova/jsk_spotkinova_robot/jsk_spotkinova.rosinstall
wstool update
##  If jsk_spot_robot package is updated, we need to merge it until the package is merged into master.
# cd jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot
# git remote add sktometometo https://github.com/sktometometo/jsk_robot.git
# git fetch sktometometo
# git merge sktometometo/develop/spot
# cd ~/spotkinova_ws/src
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -y -r
pip3 install -r jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot/jsk_spot_robot/requirements.txt
cd ~/spotkinova_ws
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash
catkin init
catkin build jsk_spotkinova_startup
```
## How to run
### Bringup robot
First, please 1.turn on spot and turn on motors according to [Bringup spot](https://github.com/sktometometo/jsk_robot/tree/develop/spot/jsk_spot_robot#bringup-spot) and 2.switch on kinova.
After that, please run the ros driver and other basic programs with `spot_kinova_bringup.launch`.
```bash
source ~/spotkinova_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch jsk_spotkinova_startup spot_kinova_bringup.launch
```

### How to control spot-kinova from roseus
For more details, please see [jsk_kinova_robot](https://github.com/708yamaguchi/jsk_robot/tree/spot-kinova/jsk_kinova_robot#use-euslisp-model) and [jsk_spot_robot](https://github.com/sktometometo/jsk_robot/tree/develop/spot/jsk_spot_robot).  
Please start roseus and type as follows.
```
(load "package://spotkinovaeus/spotkinova-interface.l")
(spot-kinova-init)
```

Below is a list of typical posture commands for kinova.
`:kinova-rest-pose` is a good posture for Spot to adopt when moving or resting.  
You should use `:kinova-rest-pose` when moving.
```
(send *spot-kinova* :reset-pose)
(send *spot-kinova* :init-pose)
(send *spot-kinova* :kinova-rest-pose)
```

To obtain current robot pose, use `:state :potentio-vector` method.
This shows all joint angles, including spot and kinova.  
The front 12 dimensions represent spot and the rest 6 dimensions represent kinova.
```
(send *ri* :state :potentio-vector) ;; #f(0.0 0.0 45.0 0.0 0.0 45.0 0.0 0.0 90.0 0.0 0.0 90.0 -0.00293 -0.165863 0.162064 -0.104492 0.045563 -0.000641)
```
Use `:angle-vector` method to specify the arm joint angle.  
If you want to send an angle-vector to kinova, you need to send the joint angles in 18 dimensions as follows.  
The first 12 dimensions are for spot, but they will be ignored and the last 6 dimensions will be sent to kinova only.
```
(send *ri* :angle-vector #f(0.0 0.0 45.0 0.0 0.0 45.0 0.0 0.0 90.0 0.0 0.0 90.0 0.0 15.0 180.0 -130.0 0.0 55.0 90.0))
```
To move the gripper 50 [mm] up, you can use `move-end-pos` method.
```
(send *spot-kinova* :head :move-end-pos #f(0 0 -50))
```
You can also use `move-end-rot` method to turn the gripper.
```
(send *spot-kinova* :head :move-end-rot -90 :z)
```
You can use `inverse-kinematics` to move arm.
```
(send spot-kinova :head :inverse-kinematics (make-coords :pos #f(700 0 500) :rotation-axis nil))
```
