# complex_recovery

This package provides recovery behavior plugins which combines multi recoveries to one recovery behavior.
This is useful for assuring a set of recovery behavior to run at one time.

There are two types of recoveries. One is to run multi recoveries sequentially and another is to run them in parallel.
