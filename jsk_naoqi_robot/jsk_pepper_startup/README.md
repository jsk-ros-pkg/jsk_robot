# jsk_pepper_startup

## What's this?

contains JSK's launch file for startup Pepper with ROS

## Running startup program

```
rossetip
roslaunch jsk_pepper_startup jsk_pepper_startup.launch network_interface:=<your network interaface (ex. eth0, enp0s31f6...)>
```

% For network_interface variable, please check `ifconfig` for the interface name your PC uses.  

% You can play audio stream from Pepper's audio ROS topic. Please see [here](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot/pull/1073) for more details.

% In order to confirm if ROS-Pepper is booting, please check with rviz.

```
roscd pepper_bringup/config
rosrun rviz rviz -d pepper.rviz
```

## Control Pepper via roseus

Please refer to [README here](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot/tree/master/jsk_naoqi_robot/peppereus).

## Sample demo

```
roslaunch nao_apps speech.launch nao_ip:=YOUR_PEPPER_IP
roslaunch nao_interaction_launchers nao_vision_interface.launch nao_ip:=YOUR_PEPPER_IP
roslaunch nao_apps behaviors.launch nao_ip:=YOUR_PEPPER_IP
rosrun jsk_pepper_startup sample.l
$ (demo1) ;; Pepper may speak twice. (This will be fixed as soon as possible.)
```

## If you failed in launching jsk_pepper_startup.launch

1. Please try deleting all the terminals you created before, and even rebooting your PC.
If another terminal of ```roscore``` has been left and the connected network has changed recently, connecting your PC and pepper may fail.

2. If your terminal log looks like below, please reboot pepper.

```
front_cameraCamera Handle is empty - cannot retrieve image
front_cameraMight be a NAOqi problem. Try to restart the ALVideoDevice.
```

## Some tips

- If the getting started wizard appears on Pepper's tablet, it may be better to turn it off because some functions are blocked. (ref: [issue 926](https://github.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot/issues/926))
