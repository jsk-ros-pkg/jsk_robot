jsk_naoqi_robot
===============

JSK original ROS package for NAO and Pepper.
The package name comes from Naoqi OS they use.

Setup Environment
-----------------
% First, you need to install ros. For ros kinetic, please refer to install guide like [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation)

1. Install ``Python NAOqi SDK``
You can download it from [here](https://community.aldebaran.com/en/resources/software). (You may need an account.)  
Please unzip the downloaded file.  
Please create ``pynaoqi`` folder in your home directory.  
Then put the file under your ``pynaoqi`` folder.  

2. Export environment variables in your ``.bashrc``

```
# Python NAOqi SDK version >= 2.5.5
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/pynaoqi/pynaoqi-python2.7-2.5.5.5-linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

# Python NAOqi SDK version < 2.5.5
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/pynaoqi/<your Python SDK package name>:$PYTHONPATH

export NAO_IP="olive.jsk.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp" % OR IP address like "133.11.216.xxx"
export ROS_IP="133.11.216.yyy" % OR run rossetip command to set ROS_IP
```
% `pose_controller.py` in `naoqi_pose` package imports `NaoqiNode` from `naoqi_node.py` in `naoqi_driver_py` package.

% `naoqi_node.py` imports `ALProxy` from `naoqi.py`.

% `naoqi.py` is located under `pynaoqi-python2.7-2.5.5.5-linux64/lib/python2.7/site-packages/`


% NAO_IP is IP address of Pepper. Pepper tells you their address when pushing their belly button.

% Please install ```ros-kinetic-jsk-tools``` to use ```rossetip``` command.


3. Install ROS packages for NAO and Pepper

```
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd  catkin_ws
wstool init src
wstool merge -t src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot/master/jsk_naoqi_robot/pepper.rosinstall
wstool update -t src
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
rosdep install -y -r --from-paths src --ignore-src
```

Then, please install Nao/ Pepper mesh files from deb with manual approval of license.  

```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-pepper-meshes
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-nao-meshes
```

If you have ROS kinetic, please apply [this change](https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_dashboard/pull/3) for the time being.

```
cd  catkin_ws/src
wstool set naoqi_dashboard --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_dashboard
wstool update naoqi_dashboard
cd naoqi_dashboard
git remote add kochigami https://github.com/kochigami/naoqi_dashboard.git
git fetch kochigami
git checkout -b modify-for-kinetic kochigami/modify-for-kinetic
```

Finally, please compile them.  

```
catkin build --continue-on-failure
source devel/setup.bash
```

% Inside `jsk_robot` package, there are many packages which are not required for `jsk_naoqi_robot`. If we fail to compile them, building process might stop and `jsk_naoqi_robot` packages might not be compiled. We might need to continue compiling (`catkin build --continue-on-failure`) in that case.


4. (optional) For NAO and Pepper developers

Please add following source codes which you need for debugging.

```
cd  catkin_ws/src
wstool set nao_robot --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/nao_robot
wstool set pepper_robot --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/pepper_robot
wstool set naoqi_driver --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_driver
wstool set naoqi_bridge --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_bridge
wstool set naoqi_bridge_msgs --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_bridge_msgs
wstool set naoqi_dashboard --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_dashboard
```

Interface when controlling NAO and Pepper via roseus
----------------------------------------------------

Common methods for NAO and Pepper are defined in `naoqieus/naoqi-interface.l`. NAO-specific methods are defined in `naoeus/nao-interface.l`. Pepper-specific methods are defined in `peppereus/pepper-interface.l`. For further details about each method, please refer to [**_naoqieus_**](naoqieus/README.md), [**_naoeus_**](naoeus/README.md), and [**_peppereus_**](peppereus/README.md) respectively.  
For some methods, they require specific branch (kochigami-develop) because they are not merged into master. If you need this, please change your branch of `naoqi_driver`, `naoqi_bridge` and `naoqi_bridge_msgs` as follows:

```
cd catkin_ws/src
wstool set naoqi_driver --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_driver
wstool update naoqi_driver
cd naoqi_driver
git remote add kochigami https://github.com/kochigami/naoqi_driver.git
git fetch kochigami
git checkout -b kochigami-develop kochigami/kochigami-develop

cd .. # catkin_ws/src
wstool set naoqi_bridge --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_bridge
wstool update naoqi_bridge
cd naoqi_bridge
git remote add kochigami https://github.com/kochigami/naoqi_bridge.git
git fetch kochigami
git checkout -b kochigami-develop kochigami/kochigami-develop

cd .. # catkin_ws/src
wstool set naoqi_bridge_msgs --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_bridge_msgs
wstool update naoqi_bridge_msgs
cd naoqi_bridge_msgs
git remote add kochigami https://github.com/kochigami/naoqi_bridge_msgs.git
git fetch kochigami
git checkout -b kochigami-develop kochigami/kochigami-develop
```

In addition, if you have ROS kinetic, please fetch the source of `nao_interaction` (master branch) for the time being ([related issue](https://github.com/ros-naoqi/nao_interaction/issues/12)).

```
cd .. # catkin_ws/src
wstool set nao_interaction --git https://github.com/ros-naoqi/nao_interaction
wstool update nao_interaction
```
