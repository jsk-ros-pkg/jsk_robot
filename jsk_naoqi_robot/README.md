jsk_naoqi_robot
===============

JSK original ROS package for NAO and Pepper.
The package name comes from Naoqi OS they use.

Setup Environment
-----------------
% First, you need to install ros. For ros indigo, please refer to install guide like [here](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu)

1. Install ``Python NAOqi SDK``
You can download it from [here](https://community.aldebaran.com/en/resources/software). (You may need an account.)  
Please unzip the downloaded file.  
Please create ``pynaoqi`` folder in your home directory.  
Then put the file under your ``pynaoqi`` folder.  

2. Export environment variables in your ``.bashrc``

```
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/pynaoqi/<your Python SDK package name>:$PYTHONPATH
export NAO_IP="olive.jsk.imi.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp" % OR IP address like "133.11.216.xxx"
export ROS_IP="133.11.216.yyy" % OR run rossetip command to set ROS_IP
```

% NAO_IP is IP address of Pepper. Pepper tells you their address when pushing their belly button.

3. Install ROS packages for Pepper

```
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd  catkin_ws
wstool init src
wstool merge -t src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsk-ros-pkg/jsk_robot/master/jsk_naoqi_robot/pepper.rosinstall
wstool update -t src
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
rosdep install -y -r --from-paths src --ignore-src
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
```
% In addition, please install ```ros-indigo-jsk-tools``` to use ```rossetip``` command.
Otherwise, please write the line below in your ```.bashrc```.
